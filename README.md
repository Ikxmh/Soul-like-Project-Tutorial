Soul-like-Project-Tutorial



Hello to those who are reading this README file!

I am currently experimenting with 3D features and found a rather interesting-- well in my opinion at least-- tutorial. The tutorial I was referring to is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKMo3pczQyc&list=PLD_vBJjpCwJtrHIW1SS5_BNRk6KZJZ7_d Anyways, this is just a learning curve for me to study 3D!

Stay safe!

Sincerely,

Ikamjot Hundal
